# couchbase_upgrade

Performs a rolling upgrade of a Couchbase cluster. It's great for keeping your cluster automatically
patched without downtime.

Nodes that already have the correct version are skipped. So the script can be executed multiple times if desired. 

Heavily tested with Couchbase version `4.5.1` and `5.0.0`.

      --version VERSION     A specific version to upgrade to or 'latest'. If
                            'latest', then the highest available version in the
                            repository will be determined. Nodes with a version

      -v, --verbose         Display of more information

Only the nodes, username and password parameters are required. This script works by default with
a YUM installation of Couchbase. But with the command parameters it can be configured for other
operating systems as well. It should also work with archive (tar) based installations.

**As root user**:

    ./couchbase_upgrade.py --nodes host1,host2,host3
                
**As non-root user with restrictive sudo rights**:

    ./couchbase_upgrade.py\
     --nodes host1,host2,host3\
     --service-stop-command 'sudo /usr/local/bin/couchbasectl service stop couchbase'\
     --service-start-command 'sudo /usr/local/bin/couchbasectl service start couchbase'\
     --upgrade-command 'sudo /usr/local/bin/couchbasectl update'\
     --latest-version-command 'sudo /usr/local/bin/couchbasectl latest-version'

# Restrictive sudo rights

The upgrade script requires several actions that must be executed as root. But it would be
better to let a non-root user execute the upgrade script with restrictive sudo rights. A nice way
to do that is with sudo line and script below. 

**/etc/sudoers.d/couchbasectl**

    # Allow myuser to use couchbasectl that can stop/start/restart the couchbase service
    myuser ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/couchbasectl

**/usr/local/bin/couchbasectl**

    #!/bin/bash
    
    # Couchbase ctl
    # This file exists to perform limited actions with sudo
    
    if [ "$1" == "service" ]; then
      if [ "$2" != 'start' ] && [ "$2" != 'stop' ] && [ "$2" != 'restart' ]; then
        echo 'Service sub command must be start, stop or restart'
        exit 1
      fi
    
      # Check if service name is empty
      if [[ -z "$3" ]]; then
        echo 'Service name must be specified'
        exit 1
      fi
    
      # Check if service name starts with "couchbase"
      if [[ "$3" != "couchbase"* ]]; then
        echo 'Service name must start with couchbase'
        exit 1
      fi
    
      systemctl $2 $3
    elif [ "$1" == "latest-version" ]; then
      sudo yum clean all >/dev/null 2>&1 &&
      yum list all couchbase-server-community | grep couchbase-server-community | awk '{ print $2 }' |
      cut -d '-' -f1 | sort --version-sort -r | head -n 1
    elif [ "$1" == "update" ]; then
      sudo yum clean all && sudo yum install -y couchbase-server-community
    elif [[ ! -z "$1" ]] ; then
      echo 'This sub command is not allowed'
      exit 1
    else
      echo 'Usage:'
      echo "./couchbasectl service (start|stop|restart) couchbase-server"
      echo "./couchbasectl latest-version"
      echo "./couchbasectl update"
    fi

# Disable SSH strict host key checking

If you have a trusted environment, you can disable strict host key checking to avoid having to type "yes"
for a SSH connection to each node. However, keep in mind that this could be a security risk.

Add to the ~/.ssh/config file of the user how executes this script:

    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
    LogLevel ERROR
